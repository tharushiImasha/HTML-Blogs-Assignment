                <h1>What is Java</h1>
            
                <p>
                    Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of
                    devices,
                    including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and
                    syntax of
                    Java are based on the C and C++ languages. <br> <br>
            
                    One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability. Once you have written code for a Java
                    program
                    on a notebook computer, it is very easy to move the code to a mobile device. When the language was invented in
                    1991 by
                    James Gosling of Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle), the primary goal was to be able to "write once,
                    run
                    anywhere." <br> <br>
            
                    It's also important to understand that Java is much different from JavaScript. Javascript does not need to be
                    compiled,
                    while Java code does need to be compiled. Also, Javascript only runs on web browsers while Java can be run
                    anywhere. <br> <br>
            
                    New and improved software development tools are coming to market at a remarkable pace, displacing incumbent
                    products
                    once thought to be indispensable. In light of this continual turnover, Java’s longevity is impressive; more than
                    two
                    decades after its creation, Java is still the most popular language for application software
                    development—developers
                    continue to choose it over languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Swift, C++, and others. As a result, Java
                    remains an
                    important requirement for competing in the job market. <br> <br>

                <h2 style="color: #1363DF;">How Java Works ?</h2>
            
                <p>
                    Before exploring the reasons for Java’s enduring popularity, let’s review what Java is in more detail and its
                    importance
                    for enterprise application development. <br> <br>
            
                    Java is a technology consisting of both a programming language and a software platform. To create an application
                    using
                    Java, you need to download the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You
                    write
                    the program in the Java programming language, then a compiler turns the program into Java bytecode—the
                    instruction set
                    for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is a part of the Java runtime environment (JRE). Java bytecode runs
                    without
                    modification on any system that supports JVMs, allowing your Java code to be run anywhere. <br> <br>
            
                    The Java software platform consists of the JVM, the Java API, and a complete development environment. The JVM
                    parses and
                    runs (interprets) the Java bytecode. The Java API consists of an extensive set of libraries including basic
                    objects,
                    networking and security functions; Extensible Markup Language (XML) generation; and web services. Taken
                    together, the
                    Java language and the Java software platform create a powerful, proven technology for enterprise software
                    development. <br> <br>
                </p>
            
                <h2 style="color: #1363DF;">Why Java Matters ?</h2>
            
                <p>
                    If you are an enterprise application developer, you already know what Java is, and it’s likely that your
                    organization
                    already has thousands, even millions, of lines of production code written in Java. You will likely need some
                    level of
                    Java expertise to allow you to troubleshoot, maintain, and upgrade your existing codebase. <br> <br>
            
                    However, it would be a mistake to view Java only in terms of legacy applications. The Java language forms the
                    heart of
                    the Android operating system, which powers by far the largest share of the world’s smartphones. Java is also
                    among the
                    most popular languages for machine learning and data science applications. Its robustness, ease of use,
                    cross-platform
                    capabilities and security make Java the language of choice for internet solutions in many enterprise shops. <br>
                    <br>
            
                    In particular, Java technology is an ideal framework for developing web applications, the foundation for a
                    digital
                    business in any industry. Java application servers are web containers for Java components, XML, and web
                    services, which
                    interact with databases and provide dynamic web content. Java application servers form a stable deployment
                    environment
                    for enterprise applications with capabilities such as transaction management, security, clustering, performance,
                    availability, connectivity, and scalability. <br> <br>
                </p>
            
                <h2 style="color: #1363DF;">Technical Benifits</h2>
            
                <p>
                    When it comes to choosing a programming language and environment for your next enterprise application, there are
                    solid
                    technical reasons to consider Java, including interoperability, scalability, and adaptability. <br> <br>
            
                    The core philosophy behind its creation—interoperability across disparate devices—remains the strongest argument
                    for
                    favoring Java for new enterprise applications. Java’s object-oriented architecture allows you to create modular
                    programs
                    and reusable code, shortening development cycles and extending the longevity of enterprise applications. <br>
                    <br>
            
                    Platform scalability is a key attribute of Java. With Java, you can use one single system across a broad range
                    of use
                    cases. Existing desktop applications can be easily adapted to run on smaller devices that have limited
                    resources. You
                    can also migrate applications from mobile to desktop, developing business apps for the Android platform and then
                    integrating them into your current desktop software, bypassing lengthy and expensive development cycles. <br>
                    <br>
            
                    Java also wins points with strategic planners for its ability to adapt to new use cases. For example, Java is
                    widely
                    considered to be an ideal platform for the Internet of Things (IoT). The typical IoT application interconnects a
                    large
                    number of disparate devices, a task that is greatly simplified by the fact that billions of devices run Java.
                    Furthermore, Java’s extensive ecosystem of developers is constantly developing and sharing new libraries with
                    functionality specifically targeted at IoT application development. <br> <br>
