                <p>
                    The software developer vs. software engineer issue confuses many aspiring technology professionals. Developers
                    and
                    engineers apply advanced technical skills to create computer programs, and their roles overlap in many ways.
            
                    <br> <br>
            
                    While the two professional roles share similar responsibilities and educational backgrounds, they generally
                    differ in
                    their methods and outcomes. Aspiring software professionals may confuse the two positions, but software
                    developers and
                    engineers typically handle different steps when creating applications.

                <p>
                    Software developers apply their advanced insights to create, test, and refine specialized computer applications.
                    They
                    primarily build programs and apps for consumer markets based on user needs. <br> <br>
            
                    In performing their core functions, software developers collaborate with other team members, including software
                    testers
                    and quality assurance (QA) analysts. Developers mainly work for specialized computer design companies, though
                    some
                    maintain permanent in-house positions in industries including finance, insurance, and manufacturing. <br> <br>
            
                    To create computer and mobile applications, software developers use tools to build, test, update, debug, and
                    refine
                    their creations. Widely used examples include GitHub, Azure, Chrome DevTools, and Atom. <br><br>
            
                    Developers also use programming languages to write the code that makes software run. Examples of common
                    programming
                    languages include Python, Java, Ruby and Ruby on Rails, HTML, C#, and C++, among others. <br> <br>
            
                    Software developers typically train by earning bachelor's or master's degrees in computer science or information
                    technology. Others develop targeted skills in compact career training programs known as coding bootcamps.
                    Aspiring
                    software developers can also build the necessary knowledge and skills through self-directed learning. <br> <br>
            
                    Developers often build their skills by working as testers and QA analysts before graduating into senior roles.

                <p>
                    Engineering principles include a general set of logic-based and process-based concepts used to guide product and
                    system
                    development. Software engineers apply engineering principles to creating applications. Examples of these
                    applications
                    include purpose-built productivity platforms, computer games, and network control systems. <br> <br>
            
                    In a sense, engineering principles function as one of the tools specifically used by software engineers. Core
                    engineering principles for software include: <br>
                </p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>The testability and maintainability of program functions</li>
                    <li>Design, verification, and assurance processes (also described as "integrity")</li>
                    <li>Clear and specific external integration standards</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>
                    Software engineers also have advanced expertise in the same development tools and programming languages. <br>
                    <br>
            
                    Unlike many other engineering specializations, software engineers do not require a license. Instead, they ascend
                    into
                    the role through targeted professional experience and strong technical skills. <br> <br>
            
                    Software engineers generally develop technical skills in academic settings, such as degree programs and
                    engineering
                    bootcamps. However, as with software development, self-directed learning remains an option for software
                    engineers. Many
                    employers value hard skills and performance capabilities over formal credentials. <br> <br>
            
                    The software engineering career path includes tiered levels covering associate, junior, intermediate, and senior
                    roles.
                    Engineers often begin in entry-level associate or junior roles, then move up the ladder every 1-3 years. <br>
