                <h1>What is OOP</h1>

                <p>
                    Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects to represent and
                    manipulate data. In OOP, data is encapsulated within objects, and objects are defined by their properties (attributes)
                    and behaviors (methods). OOP provides several key concepts that enable developers to write modular, reusable, and
                    maintainable code.

                <h2 style="color: #1363DF;">Definition of OOP Concepts in Java</h2>

                <p>
                    The main ideas behind Java’s Object-Oriented Programming, OOP concepts include <span style="color: #2157a7; font-size: 18px;"> <b>abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance
                    and polymorphism</b> </span>. Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of
                    them without compromising security. Grasping OOP concepts is key to understanding how Java works. <br> <br>
                    
                    Java defines OOP concepts as follows: <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Abstraction</b> </li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>Using simple things to represent complexity. We all know how to turn the TV on, but we don’t need to know how it works
                        in order to enjoy it. In Java, abstraction means simple things like <b style="font-size: 18px;">objects, classes</b> and <b style="font-size: 18px;">variables</b> represent more
                        complex underlying code and data. This is important because it lets you avoid repeating the same work multiple times.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <li> <b>Encapsulation</b> </li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>The practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to those fields via public methods.
                        Encapsulation is a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. We can then reuse
                        objects like code components or variables without allowing open access to the data system-wide.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <li> <b>Inheritance</b> </li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>A special feature of Object-Oriented Programming in Java, Inheritance lets programmers create new classes that share
                        some of the attributes of existing classes. Using Inheritance lets us build on previous work without reinventing the
                        wheel.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <li> <b>Polymorphism</b> </li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>Allows programmers to use the same word in Java to mean different things in different contexts. One form of polymorphism
                        is <b style="font-size: 18px;">method overloading</b>. That’s when the code itself implies different meanings. The other form is <b style="font-size: 18px;">method overriding</b>.
                        That’s when the values of the supplied variables imply different meanings. Let’s delve a little further.</dd>
                    </dl>

                </ul>

                <h3><u>How Abstraction Works</u></h3>

                <p>
                    Abstraction lets programmers create useful and reusable tools. It enables programmers to create complex systems by
                    breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components. For example, a programmer can create several different
                    types of objects, which can be variables, functions or data structures. Programmers can also create different classes of
                    objects as ways to define the objects. <br> <br>
                    
                    For instance, a class of variable might be an address. The class might specify that each address object shall have a
                    name, street, city and zip code. The objects, in this case, might be employee addresses, customer addresses or supplier
                    addresses. In addition, abstraction provides a mechanism for hiding the implementation details of a class or method from
                    the outside world and providing a simplified interface for clients to interact with. In Java, you can achieve
                    abstraction through two main mechanisms: abstract classes and interfaces. <br> <br>
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Abstract classes</b></li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>An abstract class is a class that you can’t instantiate and can only extend by subclasses. Abstract classes can have
                        both abstract and non-abstract methods. Abstract methods do not have a body and you must implement them by any subclass
                        that extends the abstract class. Non-abstract methods have a body and you can directly call them by the subclass.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <li><b>Interfaces</b></li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>An interface is a collection of methods. You can use it to define a set of behaviors that a class should implement. A
                        class can implement multiple interfaces, and all the methods defined in an interface must be implemented by any class
                        that implements it.</dd>
                    </dl>
                </ol>

                <h3> <u>How Encapsulation Works</u></h3>

                <p>
                    Encapsulation lets us reuse functionality without jeopardizing security. It’s a powerful, time-saving OOP concept in
                    Java. For example, we may create a piece of code that calls specific data from a database. It may be useful to reuse
                    that code with other databases or processes. Encapsulation lets us do that while keeping our original data private. It
                    also lets us alter our original code without breaking it for others who have adopted it in the meantime. <br> <br>
                    
                    Encapsulation provides several benefits, including:

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Data hiding</b></li>
                        <dl>
                            <dd>By hiding the implementation details of a class, encapsulation protects the data from unauthorized access and
                            manipulation.</dd>
                        </dl>
                    
                        <li><b>Modularity</b></li>
                        <dl>
                            <dd>Encapsulation helps to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components, making the codebase more
                            modular and easier to maintain.</dd>
                        </dl>

                        <li><b>Flexibility</b></li>
                        <dl>
                            <dd>By providing a controlled interface for interacting with a class, encapsulation allows for changes to the internal
                            implementation without affecting the external interface.</dd>
                        </dl>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h3><u>How Inheritance Works</u></h3>

                <p>
                    Inheritance is another labor-saving Java OOP concept that works by letting a new class adopt the properties of another.
                    We call the inheriting class a subclass or a child class. The original class is often called the parent or the
                    superclass. We use the keyword extends to define a new class that inherits properties from an old class.
                    
                    The subclass inherits all the public and protected variables and methods of the superclass, and it can also define its
                    own variables and methods. This makes it possible to create a hierarchy of classes, where each subclass inherits from
                    its superclass and adds its own unique features.
                </p>

                <h4>Benifits of Inheritance</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Reusability</b></li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>By inheriting from a superclass, a subclass can reuse the code and functionality already defined in the superclass,
                        making it easier to write and maintain code.</dd>
                    </dl>
                
                    <li><b>Polymorphism</b></li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>Inheritance allows for polymorphism, where objects of different subclasses can be treated as objects of the same
                        superclass, making it easier to write generic code.</dd>
                    </dl>
                
                    <li><b>Flexibility</b></li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>Inheritance provides a way to add new features to an existing class hierarchy without modifying the existing code.</dd>
                    </dl>
                </ol>

                <h3><u>How Polymorphism Works</u></h3>

                <p>
                    Polymorphism in Java works by using a reference to a parent class to affect an object in the child class. We might
                    create a class called “horse” by extending the “animal” class. That class might also implement the “professional racing”
                    class. The “horse” class is “polymorphic,” since it inherits attributes of both the “animal” and “professional racing”
                    class. <br> <br>
                    
                    Two more examples of polymorphism in Java are method overriding and method overloading. <br> <br>
                    
                    In <b style="font-size: 18px;">method overriding</b>, the child class can use the OOP polymorphism concept to override a method of its parent class.
                    That allows a programmer to use one method in different ways depending on whether it’s invoked by an object of the
                    parent class or an object of the child class. <br> <br>
                    
                    In <b style="font-size: 18px;">method overloading</b>, a single method may perform different functions depending on the context in which it’s called.
                    This means a single method name might work in different ways depending on what arguments are passed to it. <br> <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Benifits of Polymorphism</h4>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Flexibility</b></li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>Polymorphism allows for more flexible and adaptable code by enabling objects of different classes to be treated as if
                        they are of the same class.</dd>
                    </dl>
                
                    <li><b>Code reuse</b></li>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>Polymorphism promotes code reuse by allowing classes to inherit functionality from other classes and to share common
                        methods and properties.</dd>
